My name is YuCian (you sometimes see me with a lowercase "c") and I am a third year student at UC Berkeley studying Computer Science.

I am a passionate creator with a diverse set of skills in design and software development. I love bringing ideas to life through various mediums, and I am intrigued by the ways in which our world communicates non-verbally with maps and images.
